Installation

1. Download and install VirtualBox/VMware. In this case i prefer VmWare
2. Download a Kali Linux VM image [here](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) and import it into VirtualBox.
3. Set up networking for your VM (use bridged or NAT depending on your preference). I use Host only to not get exposed by my wifi. 
4. Install and configure the vulnerable web application. link: https://download.vulnhub.com/dvwa/DVWA-1.0.7.iso
